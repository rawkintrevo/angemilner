# TODO

- [ ] Think how it would be used with a twitter streamer. In that case you just check the token out and lock it out so no other process gets it. That would be super handy for sharky. 
- [x] Make some methods to access and display useage statistics on your keys
- [ ] Make method for updating key values (specifically rate limits) 
- [ ] make pep8 compliant
- [ ] make cool logo. some sort of ghost?
- [ ] port useage docs to pypi. no one will ever look in the wiki here.
