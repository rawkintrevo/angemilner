# TODO

- [x] Make a new example.py.  Twitter is a little more complicated because you have 4 tokens.  A nice google one perhaps

- [ ] Think how it would be used with a twitter streamer. In that case you just check the token out and lock it out so no other process gets it. That would be super handy for sharky. 
- [ ] Write useage docs
- [ ] Make some methods to access and display useage statistics on your keys
- [ ] Make method for updating key values (specifically rate limits)
